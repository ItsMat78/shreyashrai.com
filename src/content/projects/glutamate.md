## Overview
**Glutamate** is a simple browser extension designed to analyze user sentiments in comments and provide feedback. Built as part of a hackathon project, this extension leverages AI/ML models to detect the emotional tone of user comments, helping content creators optimize engagement and decision-making.

This was built in a 24-hour hackathon "Code of the Phoenix" - E-Summit 2025 at IIIT Naya Raipur

## Problem Statement
Human language expresses a wide range of emotions, and detecting sentiment in online comments can be challenging due to:
- The complexity of tone, sarcasm, and irony.
- The need for real-time emotion recognition to provide instant feedback.

## Objectives
- Detect whether a comment is **positive, negative, or neutral**.
- Provide **appropriate feedback** based on sentiment to enhance user experience.
- Ensure **ease of use** through a simple browser extension.

## Features
- **Emotion Detection:** Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides personalized feedback to users based on detected sentiment.
- **Context Awareness:** Understands the tone and context of comments.

## How to Install Extension
1. Go to Extension page on your browser.
2. Make sure developer mode is turned on
3. Click **Load Unpacked** from the sidebar
4. Select the **SentimentExtension** folder
5. Click **Load** and it will be installed on your browswer successfully.

## How to Use
1. Install the extension.
2. Highlight a comment on any website.
3. Right-click and select **'Analyze Sentiment'**.
4. View the sentiment analysis result and suggested feedback.
5. Alternatively, manually enter text in the provided textbox and press the analyze button.

## Technical Details
- **Dataset:** IMDB comment dataset (used for training the AI model).
- **AI Model:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment classification.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) for AI model integration.
- **Frontend:** JavaScript for Chrome extension UI.

### Future Improvements:
- Expanding the dataset to include platforms like Twitter and YouTube.
- Enhancing sarcasm and complex tone detection.
- Multilingual sentiment analysis.
- Multi-modal recognition (text, images, and voice analysis).
- Scalable AI solutions for real-time enterprise feedback.
